                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I started on this path because I have always had a love of computers. They connect millions of users 
                    around the world - sharing ideas, problems, solutions, and growing collectively as a society. I have been 
                    building my own PCs since I was a teenager, and briefly worked with html during my high school years, but it 
                    wasn't until recently that I made the plunge and started working toward a career in tech.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I prefer to work as part of a team, and would thrive in any team environment. Collaboration pushes everyone on 
                    a team to learn and grow. I love to learn, and I love taking on new challenges, because they force you out of 
                    your comfort zone and show you what you are truly made of. I'm always hungry, and I will work hard wherever 
                    I am at.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For me, software development is unique in that it allows creativity, dense problem solving, as well as taking 
                    things from scratch and making some amazing end results - yet all i'm <i>really</i> doing is learning how to 
                    talk to machines... so if that skynet thing ever does happen, I'm your translator.Come with me if you want to live.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I'm not coding, I'm either reading about new tech, Playing games, Reading anything else, and spending time
                    with loved ones.

                <h3>Chrono Trigger: The Quiz</q></h3>
                <p>
                    This is my Quiz App - "Chrono Trigger: the Quiz". I created this quiz app as a project requirement
                    for class, but it took on a life of its own shortly after. I used Chrono Trigger as my theme because
                    this was my favorite game growing up, and I wanted to share the fun i had with others. The app
                    iterates through questions using JS and jQuery, displays whether you got the answer right/wrong,
                    and tallies your score overall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app could easily be molded to fit with any quiz or test content, and would be great to use
                    as a teaching tool / testing tool in a classroom for multiple choice testing.

                <h3>MTG Deckbuilder</h3>
                <p>
                    This is MTG Deckbuilder, my first capstone project at Thinkful bootcamp. Magic: The Gathering is a collectible 
                    trading card strategy game. I have been playing for many years, and wanted a place where I could build and maintain 
                    my decks/ideas for decks. And so MTG Deckbuilder was born. I made this app to be a companion to players who want 
                    the ability to conceptualize, build, and store decks, as well as write down notes on card combinations or themes 
                    that make the deck powerful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created this full-stack app solo in a 4 week time period.

                <h3>Artsy</h3>
                <p>
                    This is Artsy! I created this with a team of four as a capstone project during my time at thinkful. 
                    It is an Art-Centric instagram-style social media experience. A user creates an account, shares a 
                    bit about themselves, then starts uploading their photos/art. Users can also comment, and subscribe 
                    to other users to see what inspires them, so they too may be inspired.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked with Jonathan Cochran, Michaela Bateman, and Sacha Sedriks on this project, and it is a piece
                    I am very proud of. We spent 4 weeks working together on this project, and everyone did a stellar job.
                </p>
